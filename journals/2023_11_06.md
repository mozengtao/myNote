  LXC is a userspace interface for the Linux kernel containment features. Through a powerful API and simple tools, it lets Linux users easily create and manage system or application containers.

  LXD is a next generation system container manager. The core of LXD is a privileged daemon which exposes a REST API over a local Unix socket as well as over the network (if enabled)[1].
  
  LXD isn't a rewrite of LXC; in fact it is built on top of LXC to provide a new, better user experience. Under the hood, LXD uses LXC through liblxc and its Go binding to create and manage the containers. It's basically an alternative to LXC's tools and distribution template system with the added features that come from being controllable over the network.
