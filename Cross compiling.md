- **Terminology**
	- **Build platform**: Architecture of the build machine
	- **Host platform**: The architecture you are building for
	- **Target platform**: The architecture that will handle the compiled binaries
		- Simply put, target is only relevant when working on development tools (like the compiler itself)
- When you are building for the same architecture as which you are using, build, host and target are the same. This is called a “**native**” compilation.
- If build and target platform are the same, but host is different, then we’re talking about **cross compilation**
	- e.g. the build and target platform are x86_64 (standard PC) and the host is the ARM platform(32bit ARM (armv6, armv7 or simply arm) and 64bit ARM (aarch64))
- When all three platforms are different, it’s called a “**canadian**”. This is used to **build a cross compiler for another architecture**.
